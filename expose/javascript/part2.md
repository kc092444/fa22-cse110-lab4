# Part 2

1. print 3, `i` is added up from 0 to 3 
2. print 150, `discounted price` stays the value in last iteration
3. print 150, `finalPrice`  stays the value in last iteration
4. return [50,100,150] `discounted` is within scope all the time and store all the values
5. Error : `i` is not accessible outside the for loop by using `let`
6. Error : `discountedPrice` is not accessible outside the for loop by using `let`
7. print 150, `fianlPrice` is within the scope
8. `[50, 100, 150]` because `discountedPrice` is within the scope
9. Error : `i` is not accessible outside the for loop by using `let`
10. Print 3, `length` is not changed after first assignment
11. `[50,100,150]`, array is not reassigned 
12.  
    1. `student.name`
    2. `student['Grad Year']`
    3. `student.greeting()`
    4. `student['Favorite Teacher'].name`
    5. `student['courseLoad'][0]`
13.
    1. `'32'`  //int 2 added to string 3
    2. `'1'`  // string 3 turns into integer and returns to string after calculation
    3. `3`  //null is 0
    4. `'3null'` //null becomes string
    5. `4`  //true is 1
    6. `0`  //both are interpreted as 0
    7. `'3undifined'` //undifined turns to string
    8. `Nan`    //undifined cant be convert to number
14. 
    1. `true` // 2 is converted to int
    2. `fasle`  // '2' is compared to '1' 
    3. `true`   //'2'is converted to int
    4. `false`  // ====check type equality
    5. `false` // true is converted to 1
    6. `true`   //boolean(2) returns ture

15. `==` permits type conversion, `===` checks type eqality
17. `[2, 4, 6]` is returned //`doSomething`  doubles the value passed into and goes thru every element in [1,2,3] array
19. `1 4 3 2`
